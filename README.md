This project aims to develop a Python-based Twitter sentiment analysis model to gauge public opinions about Pfizer vaccines. 
The objective is to categorize tweets into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. 
To accomplish this, we'll leverage a dataset from Kaggle and apply machine learning techniques to classify the tweets.
Furthermore, we'll investigate the performance of a logistic regression model to evaluate its accuracy in sentiment classification.
